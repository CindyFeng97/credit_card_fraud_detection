### Best Practices for Using GitHub as a Reference in Data Science Challenges
**Do**:

* Understand the Pipeline: Study how projects on GitHub establish their data pipeline, including EDA feature engineering, and the selection process for models. Focus on understanding the rationale behind pinpointing pain points and choosing specific models.

* Learn the Tools and Skills: Absorb knowledge about the tools and techniques employed in the projects, such as specific packages, functions, object-oriented programming principles, and APIs.

* Grasp Communication Techniques: Pay attention to how the authors present and explain their projects to non-technical audiences.

**Do Not**:

* Copy and Paste Code: Avoid copying code from the projects. Not only is this unethical and leading to failures in the interview process, but it also hinders your career development, as these challenges are designed to simulate your performance in a professional setting.

* Plagiarize Ideas: Do not plagiarize the ideas and pipeline of the projects. Each project should inspire your original thinking and solutions.

* Rely on Othersâ€™ Solutions: Treat the projects as imperfect examples that can guide your learning. Do not assume that they are free from errors or that their methods are the only correct approaches. Maintaining a critical perspective will enhance your problem-solving skills.

**Summary**: Instead of simply adopting others' ideas, you should focus on understanding and mastering the methods they use to develop these ideas.
